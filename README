README for diy-archives-tools

The scripts contained here are miscellaneous bits of hackery I use to maintain my personal
collection of archival-material photos, as described in this conference paper:

  http://cliotropic.org/blog/talks/camera-laptop-and-what-else/

Right now, there's not much here and it's not well-documented because I'm busy writing a 
dissertation. If you modify and improve these, I'd love to hear more about your work.


Here are the basic contents:

- image_scalers
   Automator actions to rotate and scale images. Slower than ImageMagick on the
   command line, but easier to understand what they're doing.

- imageFiler.scpt
   AppleScript to file images into folders. You'll need to edit this to point to
   your own preferred image folder before using it, and you should probably be familiar with
   AppleScript and bash shell scripting to understand what else it does.

(I use these scripts from the Scripts menu in OS X. If you want to do this, you'll need to copy
them manually to ~/Library/Scripts.)

- rename incoming image files.hazelrules
   A set of rules for Hazel ( http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php ) which will rename your image
   files in ways that preserve their original time/date stamps and name order. This is an important
   part of using the current imageFiler.  (I use Hazel because I don't like to mess with cron; 
   skilled commandline users could write a shell script that would do the same work.)
